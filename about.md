This website is my visual journal. I usually work with pencils, ink, and computers. Most content here was made by projecting thoughts into images since many compositions posted on Vokoiva are influenced by miscellaneous observations about life in general. Overall, this website was made for cataloging things Iâ€™ve seen, heard, touched, and thought about in order to explore how electronic media can create a sense of place within empty space.
